# Skyrise

**Play it: https://erlan1126.github.io/Test/**

A one-tap skyscraper building game made for phones. Your tower starts on a small floating island, next to a few houses and trees. Tap (or press Space) to drop each floor. Any part that hangs over the edge shatters and falls.

- **People are your score.** Wider floors fit more people, and perfect drops attract extra residents. Sloppy drops shrink every floor after them.
- **Gold penthouse floors** slide faster, but a perfect drop on one is worth 5x the people.
- **Landmarks:** each floor adds 5 m. A progress bar shows the next landmark to beat, from a house up to the Burj Khalifa.
- **Day to night:** the sun sets as you climb, you pass through a cloud layer, and at night the moon and stars come out while the windows light up.
- **Wind:** above about 125 m, gusts make floors speed up and slow down.
- **10 tower skins:** Glass Tower to start, then one more for every landmark you pass: Brick Block, Ocean Breeze, Candy Tower, Desert Sandstone, Retro Future, Bridge Red, Neon Nights, Art Deco and Diamond Spire. Pick one from the **Tower skins** gallery on the title and game-over screens.
- **Gentle start:** floors barely speed up for the first 15 floors, then the pace ramps up to top speed around floor 50.
- **Challenge a friend:** shares a picture of your finished tower and a link with your score in it. When a friend opens the link, their game shows your score as the one to beat.
